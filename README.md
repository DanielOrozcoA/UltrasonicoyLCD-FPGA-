# FPGA Ultrasonic and LCD
## Description
In this project, using a variable resistor (potentiometer) and an ADC integrated circuit connected to an ALTERA CYCLON IV FPGA, the direction and speed of the axis of a motor are controlled, which in turn controls a mechanism that moves an object closer and further away. regarding an Ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor readings are displayed on a 16x2 LCD expressed in actual lengths (centimeters).
